\description{
`Traitwise_pipeline()` handles the traitwise process of PRISM. It takes as input
the likelihoods and scores obtained from `Pairwise_pipeline()`. It outputs the syntheses
and the PRISM p-values by traits in the Traitwise/ folder.

Final results (PRISM p-values and pleiotropic labels, for all variants) are
written for each trait in the Results/ folder.

All parameters are passed from `PRISM_main()` and are more detailed over there.
